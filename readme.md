#Pathfinder - Wrath of the Righteous Mod

This mod will create an overpowered archetype - Assault Mage located under Cleric class.
This archetype is only available to the main character.
However, this class will have lots of skills/feats and can bypass fighter, wizard and monk pre-requisite.

It also can cast up to the full levels of cleric and wizard spells.
And have invulnerable rager damage reduction, tower shield specialist skills, armor mastery and weapon specialization.

However, the unique skills for this Archetype are
1. Arcane Armor Attunement - allowing -20 spell failure when using armor and shield
						   - This archetype also starts with arcane armor mastery and both stacks up to 40% spell failure reduction.
2. Shifting Projections - Grants 2x Intelligence bonus to AC Dodge

Also this class will have bonus of 2 wisdom upon character creation completion.

This archetype can have 2 deity and 4 domain selections and 1 secondary domain selection.
It also have 4 full bloodlines.
It is using D12 for Hit Dice.

#Issues with this mod
1. The domain spells will appear in Wizard Spellbook instead of Cleric spellbook.

#Tools for modding
This mod is modded using BPCore.
